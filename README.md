The task is simple and basic for the kind of person we are looking for. If you are unable to finish the task, even though you complete this particular task by gathering solution made up by someone else, you are likely to be terminated from the internship as you will have to do similar task on a daily basis and it is not practical for you to ask the same source for the solutions each day.
